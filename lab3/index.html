	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
  <p>In this lab we learned how to properly refer to files in html and get images to show up on our local websites</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>there wasnt too much difficulty in doing this only porblem that I ran into is originally I did not have my pictuer in a img folder so it would not show up in my website so once I put it in the img folder everything was fine.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> this resulted in a very plain website wiht a brief description of what I enjoy and then a small pciture of my self.</p>
