	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	  <p>With this lab being quite straight forward one of the only challenges we ran into was figuring out how to get the java script to show up on our websites.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I ran into problems with showing the java script on the website. everything that I wrote in the js folder seemed to be correct even when I tested it. My html code seems fine when I stack it up against Henry's, whos code is working, so I dont understand why mine isn't working.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> My results are all great untill we get to step 3 with the java script being shown on my website. I just cant seem to get that to work, I have same code as people who have it working I dont understand, there must be something small that I am missing but for now I have no idea.</p>
