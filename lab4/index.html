	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	  <p>With this lab being quite straight forward one of the only challenges we ran into was deciding weather to do frech toast or scrambled eggs for task 1.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>we ran into minor problems regarding task 4 the css was a hard hurdle for me and Henry becuase this was our first time making our websites look pretty, we also had trouble getting the right screen shot in but that was mostly a problem that I had locally witht he snipping tool on my computer and not witht he actual html code.</p>

	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p> our results came out as readable Pseudocode that was legible even to the common human being.
	<h4>Pseudocode of common task (we picked making french toast):</h4>
  	<ul>
	    <li>get long flat container</li>
      <li>crack 1 egg for each piece of toast you want</li>
      <li>add 1 tablespoon of milk for each egg cracked</li>
      <li>add ½ teaspoon of salt from each egg cracked</li>
      <li>add ½ tablespoon of sugar for each egg cracked</li>
      <li>add ½ tablespoon cinnamon for each egg cracked</li>
      <li>whisk all ingredients together in the long flat container</li>
      <li>turn on stove top to heat it up</li>
      <li>grab slices of bread for amount of toast intended</li>
      <li>soak toast in egg mixture until all egg mixture is soaked up</li>
      <li>add butter to already heated pan</li>
      <li>put soaked bread on hot pan</li>
      <li>flip after 2 min</li>
      <li>after 2 more min take off heat</li>
      <li>put toast on a plate</li>
      <li>add toppings and enjoy</li>
		</ul>
    </p>

		Pseudocode for Creating a connect 4 game
  //decide who goes first with randomizer
  //first player is assigned to red
	//second player is assigned to yellow
	//create a 7x6 grid
	//if player1 turn then:
	  //input number for grid
		//height=number of times row has been selected
		//put a red piece in the row equal to the number at height+1
	//if player2 turn then:
	  //input number for grid
		//height=number of times row has been selected
		//put a yellow piece in the row equal to the number at height+1
	//if 4 yellow pices touch then:
		//player 2 wins
	//if 4 red pieces touch then:
		//player 1 wins
