		<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	  <p>Overall this lab was the most simple lab that we have done so far, having taken python before all the functions were very familiar with me and it was very straight forward.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>There were no real problems that I had going through the lab the only minor speedbump that I had was I was missing a comma on the end of one of my lines in js and it took me a while to find out what was wrong with my code.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The results show a website that is working and helps you fix your name because your name is wrong.</p>
