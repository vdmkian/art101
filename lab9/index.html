	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	  <p>This was probably the most challenging Lab for me yet. I got stuck on modifying the css and where to start when trying to fetch the ooutput.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>My problems started with the fact that I slept through the lecture, and thats where they ended too. I stubornly tried to do the assignment without watching the lecture, eventually leading to insanity and watching the lecture and then realizing what I had been doing wrong.</p>

	<div>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The page came out great with the css change and all of my java script working as well as an understanding of how the get element works and why it works that way.</p>
