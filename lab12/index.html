	<div>
	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	  <p>This concept was an easy one for me to wrap my mind around due to alreay knowing python and "%" is used alot in python.</p>
	</div>

	<div>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Happy to say I only ran into 1 problem, where I forgot to capitalize a word in a function name.</p>
		</div>

	<div>
	<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>The results match the results that I was looking for, I added one line where if the name is exactly "Harry Potter" it would put the person in Gryffindor but this was only to find out that it would have sorted Harry into Gryffindor anyways.</p>

	<div class="input-output">
		<h2>welcome to hogwarts</h2>
		<p>Prepare to be sorted into your house >:)</p>
		<p>Enter your full name for sorting:</p>
